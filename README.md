## Running the Code

[Download .Net here](URL "https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download")

To check if you have already installed .Net, open a command prompt and run:

```
dotnet --version
```

Once .Net is installed, clone the repository and open a command prompt in the project directory.

## Overview

This project was created to explore the C# language. My goal is to begin to use the Unity game engine, which uses C#.

This was my first project in the language, so
it was chosen to be simple, yet cover a variety of topics.

This includes:

- creating class objects
- writing methods
- passing arguments
- creating variables of various data types
- using if/else logical structures
- using switch cases
- using try/except
- while loops
- for/foreach loops
- and more

Code was written in C# and formatted as a .Net project.
