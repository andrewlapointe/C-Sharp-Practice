If you would rather build the executable yourself you must first install .Net.

[Download .Net here](URL "https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download")

To check if you have already installed .Net, open a command prompt and run:

```
dotnet --version
```

Once .Net is installed, clone the repository and open a command prompt in the project directory.

To compile and run the code:

```
dotnet run
```

To compile the code and create an executable:

```
dotnet build
```
